# TriviaGame
<h2> Instructions </h2>
& This is a simple trivia game with 10 questions. The question are base on the 90's sitcom "Friends". The Scoring will consist on correctly, incorrectly answer questions and unanswer question. Correct answers will give you a relavent gif. 


<h2> Technology Utilize </h2>

We utilize the set time out functions to keep record of time. We started a counter at 15 and created an function that decrease the counter to 0 every 1000 ms. In other to update the divs with the next question, we use jquery targeting and manipulation of divs (html, append, and text functions). Framework is achive through bootstrap. For event listeners we used jquery click function. Code is modularize into functions.

<h2>Future Developments</h2>
